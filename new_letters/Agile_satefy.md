I’m writing you this email about agile and retrospective with building psychological safety, for building team, software and product.
 
Let me step back first, why I feel it’s important to share this largely at this moment.
 
What’s the problem?
 
I heard from multiple people / teams / leaders saying: We’re not doing agile.
I know a lot of conversations about failed projects, attempts saying:
* Some teams / projects are horrible, can’t be worst.
* We shouldn’t built that service as that way first ( I heard both for monolithic and for micro services ).
* Why this person can’t do that, why that person did such a bad job.
 
As a team member, I see the good initiatives and I have some wishes.
 
Good:
We’re not satisfying, we’re reinventing, we’re finding better ways.
 
My wishes:
* We’re friendly to failures in some scenario.
* We manage the risk and ROI.
* We collaborate among teams.
* We provide constructive feedbacks.
* We grow each other.
* We accept eventual consistency in real life.
 
(Life and working with people is similar to building a distributed system,
except one is with ppl, one is with machine,
different languages and
one is black and white test largely, one is black test and white test only with safety.)
(So CAP: consistency, availability and Partition tolerance need to be carefully balanced in life, since human is not machine.)
 
Why the problem matters?
 
Based on my observation: ppl who willing to work harder, contributing more are more easy to fail.
If no such ppl who taking those actions potentially failing, we as a team together, can’t move till now at all.
No matter what those ppl working on: product, engineering, process, sales, suggestion or leading.
Success is a process through iterations, success may not be a final state.
We need to provide the environment for iterations together.

(If you have more suggestions for how to solve the problem, please response me!)
 
What’s Agile:
 
Let me copy the main content here. ( Agile is principle, not rule, not practice )
 
( I see building team vs building software in 2 ways shared:
finding better ways and building a system to work, one for ppl, one for machine)
(I admit my limited knowledge and experience for the parts building a team and building software):
Manifesto for Agile Software Development
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
Why Agile helps:
 
I wish we value and respect ppl working with us, directly and indirectly, more than we value and respect ourselves. ( This needs our heart. )
I wish we value individuals and provide more opportunities for interaction among ppl cross teams, instead of individual focus. ( This needs our time. )
I wish we value working software, and when it’s not working,
we kindly point out where it’s not working and find multiple ways to make it working collaboratively
and then allocate time to correct it. ( This needs our understanding and patience. )
I wish we have more conversations and landing towards actions for the items on the right hand side on agile manifesto. ( This needs our time. )
 
Why psychological safety matters?
 
“We learned that there are five key dynamics that set successful teams apart from other teams at Google:
Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
Structure & clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters?
”

Why I’m sharing those information in this large group?
 
Because I see the issues as commonly bumped to anyone anywhere.
And I love to hear your suggestion / alternative for me.
 
Making the team safe starts from each of us: https://youtu.be/1q7gKoNI9mY?t=1749
Forward accountability and what failed instead of who failed :

What I’ll do differently? What I need from you?
 
I’ll try to care more and also dare to ask for more details.
 
I need your time, patience and encourage.
 
* I wish I’ll follow up on question “We’re not doing agile in MM”:
 
Which part do you think we could improve
( individual and interactions, working software, customer collaboration or responding to change )?
How could we improve that part?
Who can help in the improve plan?
 
 
* I wish I’ll follow up on question “We shouldn’t built that service as that way at first”,
“Some teams / projects are horrible, can’t be worst.”:
 
What’s the way you want the service to build like?
What’s the problem this way could solve vs that way?
Do we have alternative ways to achieve that goal?
How do you want to get involved in building the service?
What’s cost we expect to build that way?
What’s the budget we’re allowed to build that way?
What’s the projected earnings / benefit by building it that way?
What’s the problem / bottleneck to build that way?
How’re we going to solve the problem to build that way?
Who’re the key contributor?
What’s their concerns?
Is their concern valid?
If their concern is not valid, how could we show that concern isn’t valid?
 
* I wish I’ll follow up on question “Why this person can’t do that”,
  “why that person did such a bad job”:
 
What’s the problem we’re trying to solve by discussing that person?
What’s that person’s opinion?
What’s that person’s initiative?
What’s your initiative?
Is that person the problem?
Am I / are you the problem?
What’s that person’s strength?
What’s that person’s weakness?
How could we help that person?
How could we help ourselves?
Who can pair with the person?
Could something be changed at his side?
Could something be changed at our side?
What’s part we’re building the team by the action?
What’s part we’re hurting the team by the action?
 
I know it’s easy to say, and hard to do.
So that’s the reason I need your opt-in action, help, encourage and suggestion.
 
I believe my wishes will come true with all your help.
 
Best,
Yang Yang
